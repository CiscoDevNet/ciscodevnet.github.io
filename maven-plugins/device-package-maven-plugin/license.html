Version 1.1
Copyright (c) 2018 Cisco and/or its affiliates

These terms govern this Cisco Systems, Inc. (&#x201c;Cisco&#x201d;), example or demo source code and its associated documentation 
(together, the &#x201c;Sample Code&#x201d;). By downloading, copying, modifying, compiling, or redistributing the Sample Code, you 
accept and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the &#x201c;License&#x201d;). If you are accepting the License 
on behalf of an entity, you represent that you have the authority to do so (either you or the entity, &#x201c;you&#x201d;). Sample 
Code is not supported by Cisco TAC and is not tested for quality or performance. This is your only license to the 
Sample Code and all rights not expressly granted are reserved.

1. LICENSE GRANT: Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Cisco hereby grants to you a perpetual, 
worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to copy and modify the Sample 
Code in source code form, and compile and redistribute the Sample Code in binary/object code or other executable 
forms, in whole or in part, solely for use with Cisco products and services. For interpreted languages like Java and 
Python, the executable form of the software may include source code and compilation is not required.

2. CONDITIONS: You shall not use the Sample Code independent of, or to replicate or compete with, a Cisco product or 
service. Cisco products and services are licensed under their own separate terms and you shall not use the Sample Code 
in any way that violates or is inconsistent with those terms (for more information, please visit: www.cisco.com/go/terms).

3. OWNERSHIP: Cisco retains sole and exclusive ownership of the Sample Code, including all intellectual property 
rights therein, except with respect to any third-party material that may be used in or by the Sample Code. Any such 
third-party material is licensed under its own separate terms (such as an open source license) and all use must be in 
full accordance with the applicable license. This License does not grant you permission to use any trade names, 
trademarks, service marks, or product names of Cisco. If you provide any feedback to Cisco regarding the Sample Code, 
you agree that Cisco, its partners, and its customers shall be free to use and incorporate such feedback into the Sample 
Code, and Cisco products and services, for any purpose, and without restriction, payment, or additional consideration of 
any kind. If you initiate or participate in any litigation against Cisco, its partners, or its customers (including 
cross-claims and counter-claims) alleging that the Sample Code and/or its use infringe any patent, copyright, or other 
intellectual property right, then all rights granted to you under this License shall terminate immediately without notice.

4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: CISCO SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR USE OF THE 
SAMPLE CODE, FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR 
FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, INFORMATION, PROFITS, BUSINESS, OR GOODWILL, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY: SAMPLE CODE IS INTENDED FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES ONLY AND IS PROVIDED BY CISCO &#x201c;AS IS&#x201d; WITH ALL 
FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED 
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INTERFERENCE, AND ACCURACY, 
ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY CISCO. CISCO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SAMPLE CODE IS SUITABLE FOR 
PRODUCTION OR COMMERCIAL USE, WILL OPERATE PROPERLY, IS ACCURATE OR COMPLETE, OR IS WITHOUT ERROR OR DEFECT.

6. GENERAL: This License shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, 
excluding its conflict of laws provisions. You agree to comply with all applicable United States export laws, rules, and 
regulations. If any provision of this License is judged illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, that provision shall 
be severed and the rest of the License shall remain in full force and effect. No failure by Cisco to enforce any of its 
rights related to the Sample Code or to a breach of this License in a particular situation will act as a waiver of such 
rights. In the event of any inconsistencies with any other terms, this License shall take precedence.
